    <h2>Projects</h2>
      <p>ive worked on a lot of things but this will showcase real active projects as well as act as a graveyard for things that will never see the light of day again <br>
    this is not a full list just the biggest ones</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Active projects</h2>
    <h4>this website</h4>
    <p>this is my first "real" html. i dont know what this will look <br> like forever but i always wanted a part of the
        internet to myself like this :3
    </p>
    <br> 

<br>
    <h2>Dead projects</h2>
    
      <h4>My last friend</h4>
        <p>my last friend was a visual novel i was working on. out of all my project this is the one <br> the most people knew about. an alpha 
          build was released to (at least one person i didnt know liking it) <br> few eyes while i improved my code, writing and people even sent 
          voice lines. the project was put on <br> hold due to life and later scrapped becuase i wasnt happy with how good it was when i came back to it.
          <br> <br> <strong >Thanks to everyone who helped with this project</strong>
        </p>
      <h4>The Dingus Den</h4>
      <p>The dingus den was a weird meta tribute game to a close friend/content creator "virellis"<br>
      and while its project files are long gone i will forever be thankful for the distraction,<br> the things i learned and the people 
    who told me to keep going when i couldnt <br> <br> <strong>thanks.</strong> </p>
